        "\n",
        "Welcome back to the kitchen! Your robot chef has been working tirelessly, whipping up delicious dishes and keeping your customers happy. But lately, you’ve noticed something troubling—it’s starting to make mistakes. Maybe it’s recommending pineapple on pizza (controversial, I know), or perhaps it’s overlooking a new seasonal ingredient that’s all the rage. Whatever the reason, it’s clear that your robot chef needs a little TLC to stay at the top of its game.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lecture, we’ll explore how to monitor your robot chef’s performance and keep it up-to-date with the latest trends and tastes. Think of it as a combination of **model monitoring** and **retraining pipelines**—essentially, giving your robot chef regular check-ups and sending it back to cooking school when needed.\n",

        "### **1. The Problem: A Chef in Need of a Check-Up**\n",
        "Just like humans, machine learning models can start to underperform over time. This phenomenon is called **model drift**, and it happens for a variety of reasons:\n",
        "- **Data Drift**: The distribution of input data changes (e.g., new ingredients, seasonal trends).\n",
        "- **Concept Drift**: The relationship between inputs and outputs changes (e.g., customers now prefer gluten-free options).\n",
        "- **Performance Degradation**: The model’s accuracy drops over time as it encounters new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "If left unchecked, these issues can lead to poor predictions, unhappy customers, and even financial losses. That’s why it’s crucial to keep an eye on your model’s performance and retrain it when necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. The Solution: Model Monitoring and Retraining Pipelines**\n",
        "To keep your robot chef in top shape, we’ll use two key tools:\n",
        "1. **Model Monitoring**: Tools like **Prometheus** or **MLflow** help you track your model’s performance in real-time. They act like a health dashboard, alerting you when something goes wrong.\n",
        "2. **Retraining Pipelines**: These are automated workflows that retrain your model with new data. Think of it as sending your robot chef back to cooking school to learn new recipes and techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Model Monitoring: Keeping an Eye on Performance**\n",
        "Model monitoring is like having a sous-chef who constantly tastes the dishes and gives feedback. Here’s how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Key Metrics to Monitor**\n",
        "- **Accuracy**: Is the model still making correct predictions?\n",
        "- **Prediction Distribution**: Are there any unusual patterns in the predictions?\n",
        "- **Latency**: How long does it take for the model to make a prediction?\n",
        "- **Data Quality**: Is the input data clean and consistent?\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Tools for Monitoring**\n",
        "- **Prometheus**: A powerful tool for real-time monitoring and alerting.\n",
        "- **MLflow**: A platform for tracking experiments, metrics, and model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Example: Monitoring with MLflow**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import mlflow\n",
        "\n",
        "# Log metrics during model evaluation\n",
        "mlflow.log_metric(\"accuracy\", 0.92)\n",
        "mlflow.log_metric(\"precision\", 0.89)\n",
        "mlflow.log_metric(\"recall\", 0.91)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Log the model itself\n",
        "mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"model\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "With MLflow, you can track your model’s performance over time and visualize trends using its dashboard. If accuracy drops or prediction patterns become erratic, you’ll know it’s time to intervene.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "### **4. Retraining Pipelines: Sending Your Chef Back to School**\n",
        "Even the best models need to be retrained periodically to stay relevant. A retraining pipeline automates this process, ensuring your model is always up-to-date.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Steps in a Retraining Pipeline**\n",
        "1. **Collect New Data**: Gather the latest data (e.g., new customer orders, seasonal ingredients).\n",
        "2. **Preprocess Data**: Clean and prepare the data for training.\n",
        "3. **Retrain the Model**: Train the model on the new data.\n",
        "4. **Evaluate the Model**: Check if the retrained model performs better than the old one.\n",
        "5. **Deploy the Model**: Replace the old model with the new one.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Example: Retraining Pipeline**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
        "from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n",
        "import pandas as pd\n",

        "def load_model():\n",

        "new_data = pd.read_csv(\"new_orders.csv\")\n",
        "retrain_model(new_data)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `retrain_model` function loads the existing model, trains it on new data, and saves the updated version. You can automate this process using tools like **Airflow** or **Prefect** to run the pipeline on a schedule (e.g., every month).\n",

        "Model monitoring and retraining pipelines aren’t just for robot chefs. They’re used in a wide range of industries:\n",
        "- **E-commerce**: Keeping recommendation systems up-to-date with customer preferences.\n",
        "- **Healthcare**: Ensuring diagnostic models remain accurate as new medical data becomes available.\n",

        "### **6. Challenges and Best Practices**\n",
        "While monitoring and retraining are essential, they come with their own challenges:\n",
        "- **Data Quality**: Ensure your new data is clean and representative of the current environment.\n",
        "- **Version Control**: Keep track of different versions of your model to avoid confusion.\n",
        "- **Automation**: Use orchestration tools to automate the retraining process and reduce manual effort.\n",

        "Let’s put your skills to the test! Here’s a challenge for you:\n",
        "1. Set up a basic monitoring dashboard using MLflow to track your model’s accuracy and prediction distribution.\n",
        "2. Build a retraining pipeline that automatically retrains your model when new data is available.\n",
        "3. Simulate a scenario where the model’s performance drops and observe how your pipeline handles it.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Conclusion: A Well-Oiled Kitchen**\n",
        "Just like a real chef, your robot chef needs regular check-ups and training to stay at the top of its game. With model monitoring and retraining pipelines, you can ensure your model remains accurate, reliable, and ready to handle whatever the future throws at it.\n",
